# MATLAB and Python Codebase for "Taming Uncertainty in a Complex World: The Rise of Uncertainty Quantification — A Tutorial for Beginners"
This repository contains the MATLAB and Python code for the paper ["Taming Uncertainty in a Complex World: The Rise of Uncertainty Quantification — A Tutorial for Beginners"](https://doi.org/10.1090/noti3120), by [Nan Chen](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~nchen29/), [Stephen Wiggins](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FmdPqIUAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Marios Andreou](https://mariosandreou.short.gy/Homepage), published in the [March 2025 issue of the Notices of the American Mathematical Society](https://www.ams.org/cgi-bin/notices/nxgnotices.pl?fm=main&current=202503).

The MATLAB codebase was tested on version R2020b, while the Python codebase was tested on version 3.10.6.

The figures generated by each script are available in the corresponding subdirectory, in both ```.png``` and MATLAB ```.fig``` formats for quick reference. Associated output files (when applicable) are also provided in ```.txt``` format for both the MATLAB and Python codebase. Finally, each subdirectory (corresponding to each section of the [paper’s Supporting Document](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01823#page=13)) includes a ```Python_Requirements.txt``` file listing the necessary Python packages for the associated script file(s), formatted for use with package managers such as ```pip``` or ```conda```.
