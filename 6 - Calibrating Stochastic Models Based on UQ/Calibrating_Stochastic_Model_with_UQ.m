%
% Code: Calibrating a linear stochastic model with uncertainty quantification 
% through the second-order spatiotemporal statistics from a stochastic model 
% with cubic damping and multiplicative noise (MATLAB code).
% 
% Info: The equilibrium mean, equilibrium variance, and decorrelation time
% (temporal integral of the autocorrelation function) from a dynamic stochastic 
% model with cubic nonlinearity and correlated additive and multiplicative 
% noise are used to calibrate a linear stochastic model such that it performs 
% similarly under the criteria of model memory and model fidelity. Such 
% nonlinear models are usually used as reduced order climate models for 
% low-frequency atmospheric variability. Four different sets of parameter values 
% are used to exhibit different complex and highly non-Gaussian behaviors,
% where the aforementioned second-order spatiotemporal statistics of the given 
% time series are retrieved and used to uniquely determine the calibrated
% simplified linear system. This code aims to see the performance of the linear
% stochastic model in these different regimes. For the nearly Gaussian case, the 
% linear stochastic model will give a nearly perfect representation of the 
% results. For the highly non-Gaussian cases, only the Gaussian statistics can 
% be captured, which is the best the linear stochastic model can do.
