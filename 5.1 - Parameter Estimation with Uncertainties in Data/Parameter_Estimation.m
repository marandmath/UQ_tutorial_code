% Code corresponding to Section 5.1 - "Parameter Estimation with Uncertainties 
% in Data" in the Supplementary Document of the paper "Taming Uncertainty in a 
% Complex World: The Rise of Uncertainty Quantification â€” A Tutorial for 
% Beginners".
%
% Authors: Nan Chen, Stephen Wiggins, Marios Andreou.
%
% Code: Estimating the slope parameter 'a' in the following linear system:
%           xdot = dx/dt = ay,
%           ydot = dy/dt = bx.
% We can regard xdot, ydot, y and x as the four variables which we can use to 
% estimate said parameter (MATLAB code).  
% 
% Info: Only two data points will be considered, so the least-squares solution
% through standard linear regression will be needed; If there was only one data 
% point, then we can simply set a = xdot/y if y is non-zero. We will consider 
% two cases; One case where the data for both xdot and y are available, and one 
% where y is not directly observed and instead it is assigned a Gaussian 
% distribution at each realization which leads to nonlinear uncertainties in the 
% least-squares solution for the parameter.
